        At the start of 2024, I was stressed out because I graduated in 2023 and had 
        not been able to land a job despite applying to hundreds of companies. So this
        year I decided to lock in and learn how to code properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        January I made a couple chrome extensions to learn how to use javascript. 
        February, March, April I  enrolled in a bootcamp where I learned react, java 
        spring boot and working with rest apis. End of april I got my first job as a
        data engineer 🎉. This was when I started learning about data pipelines and doing 
        more python related stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since then I've just been messing around with projects/tech which I think 
        are fun.
